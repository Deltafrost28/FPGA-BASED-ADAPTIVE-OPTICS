# FPGA-BASED-ADAPTIVE-OPTICS

Team Name: Solution Fabricators
Team members name: Vaidehi Shirurkar, Shreyas Phansalkar, Srushti Sapkal, Sarvesh Nandanwar
Project name:  FPGA-Based Adaptive Optics (AO) StabilizerS
Project abstract:This project implements a real-time image stabilization system using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA and adaptive optics. A camera captures distorted images, the FPGA computes wavefront errors, and a PID-based control algorithm drives a deformable mirror to correct distortions. The FPGA’s parallelism ensures sub-millisecond latency, making it ideal for applications like telescopes, drones, VR/AR, and microscopes
Tech stack: XILINX ISE 14.7, GTKWave, FPGA( Spartan6-XC6SLX9_TQ144FPGA)
