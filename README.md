# FPGA-BASED-ADAPTIVE-OPTICS
This project implements a real-time image stabilization system using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA and adaptive optics. A camera captures distorted images, the FPGA computes wavefront errors, and a PID-based control algorithm drives a deformable mirror to correct distortions.
